Description: Remove files ignored by git
 clean-repo is a command-line utility that removes files and directories
 ignored by Git's .gitignore patterns. It operates in dry-run mode by
 default for safety, showing which files would be deleted before any
 actual removal occurs.
 .
 The tool supports pattern exclusion, allowing users to keep specific
 files while cleaning others. It includes verbose and quiet modes for
 flexible output control.
